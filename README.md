# Cleaning and preparation:
We can see the raw dataset below, you can view the raw data at this **[LINK](https://github.com/al1fandi/HR_Project/blob/03a454e8a274b90ac5bce4176399c9bde9fdd867/table/raw_data_hr.csv)**. The date column did not display the appropriate format, so the dataset had to be cleaned and prepared for the analysis process.
